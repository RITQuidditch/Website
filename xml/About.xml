        <title>RIT Quidditch</title>
        <body>RIT Quidditch is the official promoter of the exciting sport of Quidditch at RIT. The club's origins go back to fall of 2009. A Facebook invite to "Muggle Quidditch" brought together a rag tag group of friends, who turned the idea to reality. Though small, the club gained notoriety through a Reporter cover story and work of mouth through out the following winter and spring. By the beginning of next academic year, RIT Quidditch was recognized as an official RIT club.&#x3C;br/&#x3E;&#x3C;br/&#x3E;Today, RIT Quidditch is an official member of the International Quidditch Association (IQA). We hold intramural scrimmage matches on the RIT campus, as well as providing for competition against other schools and teams. Anyone and Everyone is welcome to show up to our regular scrimmages, held every week.</body>

        <title>Dark Marks</title>
        <body>The Dark Marks are the competitive arm of the RIT Quidditch club. A fearsome Quidditch force, they compete against other IQA teams from Western New York and participate in larger tournaments from teams across the country. Anyone interested in playing with the Dark Marks must show reasonable commitment to the team, but new comers are welcome to show up to any practice.</body>
